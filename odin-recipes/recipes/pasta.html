    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine, typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a clean surface, make a mound with the flour and create a well in the center. Add the eggs and salt into the well.</li>
        <li>Using a fork, beat the eggs gently, then gradually incorporate the flour starting from the inner rim of the well.</li>
        <li>Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After resting, roll out the dough to your desired thickness and cut it into your preferred shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, then drain and serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
    </ol>
